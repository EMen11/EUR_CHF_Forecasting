# EUR/CHF Forecasting: Statistical & Machine Learning Models (2015â€“2025)

## 1. Project Context  
The foreign exchange (FX) market is one of the most liquid and data-rich environments in finance. Among currency pairs, **EUR/CHF** is particularly relevant due to its economic and geopolitical importance in Europe and Switzerland.  
This project investigates whether **short-term forecasting at horizon T+1 (one day ahead)** is feasible using both classical statistical approaches and modern machine learning techniques.  

The work follows a full **end-to-end pipeline**: from data collection and cleaning, to baseline models, statistical benchmarks, and advanced ML implementations, with a focus on **reproducibility and financial interpretation**.

---

## 2. Objectives  
The project is designed around two central goals:  

- **Forecasting objective**: evaluate whether the daily EUR/CHF exchange rate returns can be predicted one day ahead.  
- **Methodological comparison**: benchmark **classical statistical models** (ARIMA, GARCH, Holt-Winters) against **machine learning models** (Ridge Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Stacking).  

The ultimate aim is not only to test predictive power but also to draw lessons on the **limits of predictability in FX markets** and the conditions under which models provide business value (e.g., risk sizing, volatility awareness).

---

## 3. Pipeline Overview  
The project follows a structured 9-part pipeline to ensure clarity and reproducibility:  

1. **Data collection**  
   - Source: Yahoo Finance (`EURCHF=X`).  
   - Period: 2015â€“2025 (â‰ˆ 2,800 business days).  

2. **Data preparation**  
   - Compute log-returns for stationarity.  
   - Perform chronological **train/test split** (2015â€“2022 for training, 2023â€“2025 for testing).  
   - Create **engineered features**: lagged returns, rolling means, rolling volatilities.  

3. **Modeling**  
   - **Baselines**: NaÃ¯ve, Moving Average, Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES).  
   - **Statistical models**: ARIMA, SARIMA, GARCH, Holt-Winters.  
   - **Machine Learning (ML) baselines**: Ridge, Lasso.  
   - **Advanced ML**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, Stacking & Blending.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: RMSE, MAE (MAPE discarded due to near-zero returns).  
   - Validation: expanding/rolling splits and **walk-forward backtesting**.  
   - Diagnostics: residual analysis, volatility regime breakdown, feature importance.

**Key principles**  
- Clear separation between raw and processed data â†’ ensures traceability.  
- Scripts (`src/`) generate results reproducibly and save outputs in `results/`.  
- Figures and final report are centralized in `reports/`.  
- Environment files (`environment.yml`, `requirements.txt`) guarantee that anyone can recreate the same Python environment.

## 5. Key Results  

The analysis compared **baselines, classical statistical models, and machine learning models** on the EUR/CHF daily log-returns (2015â€“2025).  

### ðŸ”¹ Main findings  
- **Best overall models**:  
  - **SES (Simple Exponential Smoothing)** and **ARIMA(2,0,1)** achieved the lowest RMSE and MAE.  
  - Both are simple, robust, and highly competitive benchmarks.  

- **Machine Learning (ML)**:  
  - **Linear Ridge** performed on par with SES/ARIMA.  
  - **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** captured non-linearities but did not significantly improve over statistical models.  
  - **Stacking (RF + GBDT with Ridge meta-model)** matched SES/ARIMA but did not outperform them.  

- **Conclusion**:  
  In noisy FX markets, **simplicity and robustness outperform complexity** unless enriched with **exogenous features** (macro variables, volatility indices, calendar effects).

1. **EUR/CHF Exchange Rate (2015â€“2025)**  
   - Historical series used for modeling.  

2. **Distribution of Log-Returns**  
   - Heavy tails and skewness confirm challenges in forecasting.  

3. **Leaderboard of Models (RMSE on Test Set 2023â€“2025)**

### Quantitative Summary (Test 2023â€“2025)  

| Model        | RMSE     | MAE     | Î” vs SES |
|--------------|----------|---------|----------|
| SES          | 0.003321 | 0.002506 | â€” |
| ARIMA (2,0,1)| 0.003322 | 0.002509 | â‰ˆ0% |
| Ridge        | 0.003342 | 0.002515 | +0.5% |
| RandomForest | 0.003362 | 0.002528 | +1.1% |
| XGBoost      | 0.003410 | 0.002556 | +2.5% |
| LightGBM     | 0.003569 | 0.002676 | +7.3% |
| Stacking     | 0.003324 | 0.002506 | â‰ˆ0% |

 **SES and ARIMA remain the champions**, with Ridge and Stacking as close challengers.  
Complex models add little value without exogenous variables.
